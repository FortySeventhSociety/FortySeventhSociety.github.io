### Game of Life in React and Redux

An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in React and Redux. 

Read the rules of the game on the [Game of Life Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

You can click to add your own cells or generate a random grid.  You can also step through one generation at a time or play/pause to automatically advance generations.
