# CSS 3D Animated Chart

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ejones/pen/DgLeGO](https://codepen.io/ejones/pen/DgLeGO).

3D prisms created purely with HTML and CSS3(D) transforms, shaded with CSS gradients, animated with CSS transitions. AngularJS is used to wire up an updating dataset.
